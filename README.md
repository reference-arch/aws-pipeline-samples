Data Pipeline Samples
=====================
AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks. You define the parameters of your data transformations and AWS Data Pipeline enforces the logic that you've set up.


# Running the samples
##Setup
1 Get the samples by cloning this repository. 
```sh
 $> git clone https://github.com/awslabs/data-pipeline-samples.git
```

2 Set up a python [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) with the dependencies needed to run these examples. This includes the [awscli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) and [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) packages.

```sh
 $> # install virtualenv
 $> pip install virtualenv

 $> # in the root directory of data-pipeline-samples:
 $> virtualenv venv
 $> source venv/bin/activate
 $> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you are finished experimenting with the examples, deactivate the virtual environment:

```sh
 $> deactivate
```

3 Create AWS IAM roles to run the samples using AWS CLI.

```sh
 $> aws datapipeline create-default-roles 
```

##Run the Hello World sample

The hello world sample demonstrates a pipeline that creates an EC2 instance and runs `echo Hello World!`. It can be used as a reference template for executing arbitriy shell commands.  

###Step 1
Create the pipelineId by calling the *aws data pipeline create-pipeline* command. We'll use this pipelineId to host the pipeline definition document and ultimately to run and monitor the pipeline. The commands in this section should be called from within the virtual environment that you created above.

```sh
 $> aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name hello_world_pipeline --unique-id hello_world_pipeline 
```

You will receive a pipelineId like this. 
```sh
#   -----------------------------------------
#   |             CreatePipeline             |
#   +-------------+--------------------------+
#   |  pipelineId |  df-0554887H4KXKTY59MRJ  |
#   +-------------+--------------------------+
```

###Step 2
Upload the helloworld.json sample pipeline definition by calling the *aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition* command. This will upload and validate your pipeline definition. 

```sh
  $> aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-id df-0554887H4KXKTY59MRJ \
  --pipeline-definition file://samples/helloworld/helloworld.json \
  --parameter-values myS3LogsPath="s3://<your s3 logging path>"
```

You will receive a validation messages like this
```sh
#   ----------------------- 
#   |PutPipelineDefinition|
#   +-----------+---------+
#   |  errored  |  False  |
#   +-----------+---------+
```
###Step 3
Activate the pipeline by calling the *aws datapipeline activate-pipeline* command. This will cause the pipeline to start running on its defined schedule. 

```sh
  $> aws datapipeline activate-pipeline --pipeline-id df-0554887H4KXKTY59MRJ
```

Check the status of your pipeline 
```sh
  >$ aws datapipeline list-runs --pipeline-id df-0554887H4KXKTY59MRJ
```

You will receive status information on the pipeline.  
```sh
#          Name                                                Scheduled Start      Status
#          ID                                                  Started              Ended
#   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#      1.  A_Fresh_NewEC2Instance                              2015-07-19T22:48:30  RUNNING
#          @A_Fresh_NewEC2Instance_2015-07-19T22:48:30         2015-07-19T22:48:35
#   
#      2.  ShellCommandActivity_HelloWorld                     2015-07-19T22:48:30  WAITING_FOR_RUNNER
#          @ShellCommandActivity_HelloWorld_2015-07-19T22:48:  2015-07-19T22:48:34

```
##Examine the contents of the sample pipeline definition 
Let's look at the Hello world example pipeline located at samples/helloworld/helloworld.json. 

```json
{
  "objects": [
  { 
      "myComment": "This object is used to set default configuration for objects 
      in the pipeline",
      
      "id": "Default",
      "failureAndRerunMode":"cascade",
      "resourceRole": "DataPipelineDefaultResourceRole",
      "role": "DataPipelineDefaultRole",
      "pipelineLogUri": "#{myS3LogsPath}",
      "scheduleType": "cron",
      "schedule": {
        "ref": "DefaultSchedule"
      }
   },
   {
      "myComment": "This object is used to specify the time-based trigger for executing 
      Activities and for provisioning Resources of the pipeline. In this case it is used 
      by the 'Default' object so it will cascade down to all other objects in the pipeline 
      if they do not override it. For this example, we use it to specify that our pipeline 
      should execute immediately upon activation. Also, we are using the 'occurrences' 
      option to specify that the pipeline should be run only once. Note: You can have multiple 
      schedules defined in a pipeline.",

      "type": "Schedule",
      "id": "DefaultSchedule",
      "occurrences": "1",
      "period": "1 Day",
      "startAt": "FIRST_ACTIVATION_DATE_TIME"
    },
    { 
      "myComment": "This object is used to create the Amazon EC2 Instance that activities 
      in the pipeline will be executed on.",

      "id": "A_Fresh_NewEC2Instance",
      "type": "Ec2Resource",
      "terminateAfter": "1 Hour"
    },
    {
     "myComment": "This object is a ShellCommandActivity. It is used to specify the linux 
     shell command that will be invoked. In this case it is simply running the 'echo' command, 
     but it can be used to run any command that is accessible on in the commandline shell of the 
     Instance that runs on.",

      "id": "ShellCommandActivity_HelloWorld",
      "runsOn": {
        "ref": "A_Fresh_NewEC2Instance"
      },
      "type": "ShellCommandActivity",
      "command": "echo 'Hello World!'"
    }
  ],
"parameters": [
     {
        "myComment": "Pipeline Parameters are placeholders for variables that a user can specify 
        when uploading or activating the pipeline. In this example, we create a Parameter 
        called 'myS3LogsPath' which is used to provide an S3 location for output logs. It is 
        referenced above in the 'Default' object to set the 'pipelineLogUri' value. Parameters 
        help users avoid hard coding variables in pipeline definitions. Users can supply these 
        parameters when calling 'aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition' or 'aws datapipeline
        activate-pipeline-definition'.",

        "id" : "myS3LogsPath",
        "type" : "AWS::S3::ObjectKey",
        "description" : "S3 path for pipeline logs."
     }
   ]
}
```
